                     At the start of the twentieth century, formal education gained greater significance in the United
                     States. With the frontier mostly gone by 1910 and most Americans living in towns and cities,
                     industrialization and a new focus on credentials made education increasingly vital for economic and
                     social advancement. Schools were also seen as the most significant <strong>means</strong> for integrating immigrants
                     into American society.
                     <!-- The full passage continues here --> <br> <br>
                     The arrival of many southern and eastern European immigrants around this time <strong>led to</strong> a significant
                     expansion in formal schooling. By 1920, most states had made schooling until at least age fourteen
                     compulsory, and the school year was extended. Public schools increasingly influenced students'
                     lives through kindergartens, vacation schools, extracurricular activities, vocational education,
                     and counseling. They also offered classes for adult immigrants, with support from schools,
                     corporations, unions, churches, settlement houses, and other organizations
                     <br><br>
                     Early twentieth-century reformers proposed that education programs should be tailored to meet the
                     needs of different groups. Immigrant women were one such group. Schools aimed to prepare young
                     women to take on valuable roles in the urban industrial economy, with many educators viewing the
                     home as a suitable environment for women.
                     <br><br>
                     While immigrant women were accustomed to managing a household and family, American education
                     redefined homemaking. In pre-industrial times, homemaking involved both producing and consuming
                     goods and often included activities that generated income, both within and outside the home.
                     However, by the early twentieth century, with overproduction becoming an issue, the ideal American
                     homemaker was seen more as a consumer than a producer. Schools trained women to be efficient
                     homemakers by focusing on cooking, shopping, decorating, and child care in <strong>their</strong> own homes, or, if
                     needed, working in the homes of others. Later reforms have made these ideas seem outdated.
