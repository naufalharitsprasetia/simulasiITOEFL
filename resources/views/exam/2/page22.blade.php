                    Color in textiles is produced by dyeing, by printing, or by painting. Until the nineteenth century,
                    all dyes were derived from vegetable or, more rarely, animal or mineral sources.
                    <!-- The full passage continues here --> <br> <br>
                    Since madder plants could be grown practically everywhere, the roots of some species of the madder
                    plant family were used from the earliest period to produce a
                    whole range of reds. Red animal dyes, derived from certain species of scale insects, were also
                    highly valued from ancient times through the Middle Ages. Blues were obtained from indigo, which was
                    widely cultivated in India and exported from there, and from wood, a plant common in Europe and also
                    used in the Near East from the
                    beginning of the Christian era. Before the first, nonfading “solid” green was invented
                    in the early nineteenth century, greens were achieved by the overdyeing or overprinting of yellow
                    and blue. However, yellow dyes, whether from weld or some other plant source such as saffron or
                    turmeric, <strong>invariably</strong> fade or disappear. This accounts for the
                    bluish tinge of what were once bright greens in, for example, woven tapestry. The range of natural
                    colors was hugely expanded and, indeed, <strong>superseded</strong> by the
                    chemical dyes developed during the eighteen hundreds. By 1900 a complete range of synthetic colors
                    had been evolved, many of them reaching a standard of resistance to fading from exposure to light
                    and to washing that greatly exceeded that of natural dyestuffs. Since then, the petroleum industry
                    has added many new chemicals, and from these other types of
                    dyestuffs have been developed. Much of the research in dyes was
                    stimulated by the peculiarities of some of the new synthetic fibers. Acetate rayon, for example,
                    seemed at first to have no affinity for dyes and a new range of dyes had to be developed; nylon and
                    Terylene presented similar problems. The printing of textiles has
                    involved a number of distinct methods. With the exception of printing patterns directly onto the
                    cloth, whether by block, roller, or
                    screen, all of these are based on dyeing; that is, the immersion of the fabric in a dye
                    bath.
